# RESOLVER - DESIGN MUSEUM GENT

Node-based service, part of the museum data infrastructure, to maintain a healthy upstream for the [REST-API](https://github.com/designmuseumgent/dmg-rest-api) of Design Museum Gent. This service is running inhouse on a recycled (otherwise obsolete) mac Mini which is rebooted to run DEBIAN.

## WHAT IT DOES.

- each month (first day of the month) it does a full check for the museums' postgres database is vetted for inconsistencies and errors - to ensure a healthy upstream.
- each week (on sunday) it rechecks those objects that have recieved a status of UNHEALTHY
- each day it checks only those items that have recieved a STATUS: UNKNOWN - these are usiually new objects that need to recieve a URI and resolving route
- inconsistencies include (entity duplicates, HTTP Client and/or Server errors, misalignment between PID and metadata (due to changes in registration (fe. changing objectnumber) f.e.))
- based on the switch cases (mentioned above), each endpoint is given a status (healthy / unhealthy)
- based on the status, the route to which the Persistent Uniform Resource Locator needs to (re)direct is defined and stored in the DB to be used when resolving.
- a status report is generated so if necessary, our staff is aware of what changes need to be made.

## DEPENDENCIES

- [node-service-eventstream-api](https://github.com/StadGent/node_service_eventstream-api) (service publishing eventstreams from our data)
- Postgres Database (Supabase instance)
- IIIF persentation API
- IIIF image server

This way the museum wants to ensure Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (PURL) - to both maintain a healthy upstream and ensure accesibility to our data.
